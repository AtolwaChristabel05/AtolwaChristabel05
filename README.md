ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Christabel Atolwa, a data analyst with a passion for transforming raw data into meaningful business solutions.

ðŸ‘€ I specialize in SQL, Python, and statistical analysis, with proven expertise in extracting actionable insights from complex datasets to drive informed decision-making.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new techniques in data visualization and advanced analytics to enhance my skill set further.

ðŸ’¼ In my most recent role at Studypool, Kenya (Remote), I utilized data visualization tools to effectively communicate business insights and streamlined data processing for faster results. I also deployed predictive analytics models and developed customized reports to summarize data in visually appealing formats.

ðŸ’¼ Previously, at ShopOkoa, I engaged with top management to operationalize data solutions, performed data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) for warehousing, and utilized Python, Power BI, and Excel for solution-based data visualization.

ðŸŽ“ I hold a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science from Jomo Kenyatta University and have completed a Data Science program at Moringa School, Nairobi, as well as a Data Storytelling with PowerBI certification from Pragmatic Works.

ðŸ’¼ In addition to my professional experience, I have volunteered as a Remote Marketing Data Analyst on Upwork projects, where I conducted comprehensive data analysis on marketing campaigns and collaborated with teams to optimize strategies. I've also worked as a Virtual Research Assistant at KPU University, Canada, contributing to research projects focused on consumer behavior and technology adoption patterns.
